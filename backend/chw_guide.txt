*** CHAPTER 1: The Role of Community Health Workers ***

The Role of Community Health Workers
Amie Fishman, Karen Winkler, and Elena Schwolsky

This chapter provides three activities and two assessments for training community health workers (CHWs) to understand the roles, competencies, and characteristics they need to be successful CHWs. The work of CHWs occurs in clinical settings and as part of organizations, as well as informally in community settings and homes.

This guide corresponds to, and is meant to be used with, Chapter 1, "The Role of Community Health Workers," of Foundations for Community Health Workers, Second Edition.

CHAPTER AT A GLANCE
This chapter comprises up to 4 hours of training content. Training about the roles, core competencies, and characteristics of CHWs typically occurs early on in the CHW program at City College of San Francisco (CCSF) and is revisited periodically as learners assess their own skill and knowledge development throughout the program. We recommend incorporating some icebreakers and community-building activities, especially early on in a training program. The content in this chapter is designed to be covered in one to two classes or training sessions.

ACTIVITY 1.1: ROLES, COMPETENCIES, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF CHWS
This activity prepares learners to identify roles, competencies, and characteristics of CHWs across a wide variety of fields.

* Learning Outcomes: Explain common roles CHWs play; Articulate core competencies associated with community health work; Identify essential qualities and characteristics of successful CHWs.

ACTIVITY 1.2: IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCCESSFUL CHWS
This activity enables learners to identify important personal qualities or characteristics of successful CHWs. By drawing on personal experiences of receiving assistance, learners are able to put themselves in their clients' and prospective clients' positions.
* Learning Outcomes: Describe personal qualities and characteristics common among successful CHWs; Name personal strengths and assets they bring to their work as CHWs; Identify areas for growth and improvement.

*** CHAPTER 2: The Evolution of the Community Health Worker Field ***

The Evolution of the Community Health Worker Field
Amie Fishman and Noelle Wiggins

This chapter provides four activities and one assessment designed to promote an understanding of the history of community health workers (CHWs). Although the CHW field is sometimes considered to be emerging in the US, CHWs have a long and rich international and national history. Understanding the historical context is critical for the success of community health work and for the sense of pride and value CHWs can and should feel about the important work they do. This history also frames the work of CHWs today and sets the stage for future contributions.

Group Facilitation
Joani Marinoff
21

This chapter provides two activities and an assessment for training community health workers (CHWs) in facilitating groups. CHWs may be asked to facilitate a variety of groups designed to bring people together to discuss and learn about common concerns and to support each other in taking actions that will enhance their health and well being.

--- PAGE 2 ---
CHAPTER AT A GLANCE
Group Facilitation

This chapter comprises up to 3 hours of training content.
This guide is meant to be used when teaching/training Chapter 21 of Foundations for Community Health Workers, Second Edition. We have included step-by-step activities for key sections, not the entire chapter. We recommend reading Chapter 21 in Foundations, as the textbook provides more material about group facilitation, as well as a deeper explanation of concepts related to activities in this guide.

ACTIVITY: ACTIVITY 21.1: REVIEW OF KEY CONCEPTS FOR GROUP FACILITATION (70-90 MINUTES)
This activity engages learners in an introductory discussion of key concepts for group facilitation, including the benefits and challenges of group work, and the qualities and skills of successful group facilitators.
LEARNING OUTCOMES: Analyze and discuss key concepts and skills for group facilitation.
Includes: Learner Handout 21.1 A: Individual Reflection

ACTIVITY: ACTIVITY 21.2: GROUP FACILITATION PRACTICE (70-90 MINUTES)
This activity provides learners with the opportunity to practice group facilitation or observe basic facilitation techniques.
LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
- Discuss the experience of participating in a group referencing key concepts and skills from Chapter 21.
- Identify challenges and benefits from the group practice session.
- Analyze approaches to group facilitation including roles and skills.
Includes: Learner Handout 21.2 A: Roles of Facilitator, Co-Facilitator, and Observer

ANSWER KEY OR RUBRIC: Rubric

--- PAGE 4 ---
Activity 21.1
Review of Key Concepts for Group Facilitation
70-90 MINUTES

MATERIALS NEEDED:
- Flip-chart paper or board and enough markers for all learners
- Copies of "Learner Handout 21.1 A: Individual Reflection"

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- Analyze and discuss key concepts and skills for group facilitation.

Introduction:
Frame this activity as a first opportunity to talk about key concepts for group facilitation based on the learners' prior experience in groups as members or facilitators and readings from Chapter 21 and other sources. The goal is for learners to reflect, analyze, and discuss concepts and skills to guide their work in facilitating groups.

Large Group Discussion:
Begin by asking learners to share their experience and knowledge of group work by posing questions such as these:
- What types of groups have you participated in?
- What was the focus of these groups?
- Where were they held?
- Who facilitated these groups?

You may wish to write down the types of groups identified by learners and cluster the examples into categories such as educational groups, support groups, or social groups.

Key messages to frame the discussion:
- Group work is a common way to create a space for people to share their experiences and interests and support one another in making change.
- Group work can be a powerful force and is very different than working one-on-one with a client because groups provide the opportunity for dynamic interaction with everyone participating—making the group itself the change agent.
- Facilitators and co-facilitators have some essential functions: to create and maintain safety for group members and to support the leadership of group members.
- Groups each have their own culture with rules, roles, boundaries, and values. Facilitators help the group establish group rules or agreements, acknowledge and appreciate the roles members play, help manage boundaries, and establish and articulate their shared values.

Large Group Brainstorm and Discussion:
Brainstorm potential benefits and harms of group work.
Possible benefits: enhancing skills for conflict management; sharing knowledge/skills (contagion); sense of community (cohesion); mutual support.
Possible harms: Subgrouping (excluding members), Contagion (reinforcing negative attitudes), Avoidance (avoiding difficult topics).

Discuss the role of group facilitators in preventing harms and maximizing benefits.

Individual Reflection on the Role of Group Facilitators:
Ask learners to complete "Learner Handout 21.1 A: Individual Reflection".

Large Group Discussion and Gallery Walk:
Post flip-chart paper labeled "Personal Qualities" and "Facilitator Skills."
Ask learners to write their ideas on the paper based on their reflection.
Discussion points on Facilitator Skills:
- Fulfilling the executive function (managing rules/roles).
- Caring (conveying interest).
- Supporting expression of emotion and meaning.
- Focusing on the present.
- Using silence.
- Triangulating (broadening conversation).

Discussion in Pairs:
Learners share responses to:
- What personal quality do you have that you wish to build on?
- What one skill do you most want to learn or enhance?

Reinforcement:
Reinforce key messages: CHWs are well positioned to facilitate groups; facilitating requires specific skills; supervision is essential; principal roles are safety and supporting leadership; cultural humility is key.

--- PAGE 9 ---
Learner Handout 21.1 A: Individual Reflection
Please reflect on your experience as a group member or facilitator and your reading of Chapter 21.
1. Identify one personal quality that you think is important for successful group facilitators.
2. Identify a key skill or responsibility of group facilitators that you strongly feel is essential for effective group work.
3. Identify one of your own personal qualities that will be an asset or positive resource in your role as a group facilitator.
